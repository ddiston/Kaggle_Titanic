# The Titanic Challenge

My Solution to the Titanic Kaggle Challenge


* <b><ins>This solution is still in progress</ins></b>

<br/><br/>

## Progress So Far

I will be breaking this challenge up between two different notebooks:
* This first notebook will focus on exploration and visualization of the data, including preprocessing the data to remove missing values, and feature engineer
* The second notebook will focus on the modeling required to predict survival

### Focus of Preprocessing
>* Exploration of Missing Values (NaN Observations)
>* Consider Either Removal or Imputation<br/><font size = '1'>
>   * Column or Row Deletion
>   * Linear/Mean Imputation</font>

### Focus of EDA
>* Data Import
>* Exploration of the Variables<br/><font size = '1'>
>   * Datatype
>   * Range
>   * Min/Max/Mean
>   * Unique Values</font>
>   * Visualization of Data Distributions
    
--------------
Following both the **EDA** and **Preprocessing** steps, visuals and preprocessed dataframes (.csv) will be exported to their respective folders within the working directory.

### <u>Requirements</u>
* Data can be obtained from Kaggle (data is also included in this repository)
* Python Libraries:<br/><font size = '3'>
    * numpy
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    * scikit-learn
